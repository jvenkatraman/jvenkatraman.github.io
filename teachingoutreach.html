									<h3>Teaching</h3>
									<p><i>EPS SCI 101 Earth's Energy: Diminishing Fossil Resources and Prospects for Sustainable Future</i><br>An upper division EPSS course which teaches students about Earth science and Earth's energy resources from a sustainability perspective. Includes four TA-led lab sections with experiments that connect lecture content to the physical science | <a href="101_evals.pdf" download>2023 Winter Teaching Evaluations (Section 1A)</a></p>

									<br><h3>Exploring Your Universe</h3>
									<p><a href="https://exploringyouruniverse.ucla.edu/">EYU</a> is the largest science fair held on the UCLA campus every year with the goal of sharing science through hands-on learning to inspire the next generation of scientists. In the past, I have served on the EYU organizing committee, and continue to serve as the booth leader for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhoBg6O5EhE">Diviner: The Moon in Infrared.</a></p>

									<h3>Unlearning Racism in Geoscience</h3>
									<a href="#" class="image mini_right"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The Unlearning Racism in Geoscience (<a href="https://urgeoscience.org/">URGE</a>) initiative, funded by the National Science Foundation, was created after the events surrounding the death of George Floyd. The closely aligned Black Lives Matter movement sparked difficult conversations about racism, and the need for institutions to move towards active anti-racism. Since Geoscience continues to be one of the least diverse STEM disciplines, the project URGE evolved as an effort to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in the Geosciences.</p>
									<p>The <a href="https://urge.epss.ucla.edu/">UCLA EPSS URGE pod</a> has been working on drafting deliverables with suggested changes to departmental policy that could help to establish a more diverse, equitable and inclusive environment. We encourage anyone wanting to join our pod, or with ideas on how to improve our deliverables, to <a href="https://urge.epss.ucla.edu/feedback-contact-us/">reach out to us.</a></p>
