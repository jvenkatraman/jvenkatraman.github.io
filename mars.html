									<p><b>Ice on Mars</b> has been of interest to planetary scientists, geologists, and astrobiologists for decades. It plays a key role in 
										understanding Mars'- and by extension Earth's- geologic and climatic history. Since water and ice support life as we know it on Earth, 
										Martian ice holds great astrobiological value and supports future exploration of our Solar System. It follows that studying the nature 
										of Martian surface and subsurface ice can tell us a lot about the planet's history. Consequently, <b>I am interested in exploring the 
										cryo-geology of the Red Planet, and how it can inform our knowledge of its water-rich past.</b></p>

									<p>Araneiforms, colloquially termed <i>spiders</i>, are  Martian ice sublimation features that have no known Earth analogs. They are 
										characterized by a central depression with radially emerging dendritic troughs. Spiders are 
										thought to form to their current extent as a result of the extension and recession of seasonal CO<sub>2</sub> ice overlying 
										the South Polar Layered Deposit (SPLD) cryptic region.</p>
									
									<p>Owing to the lack of ground truth observations and field analogs, these features are relatively poorly understood. Despite multiple observational 
										campaigns over the last 6 MY, no spiders have been observed to actively form or grow on the SPLD. I currently work with the Mars Science team at JPL to investigate 
										the differences between spider formation in distinct frost conditions- <i>cryptic</i> and <i>non-cryptic</i>- to help us draw conclusions about
										the thermophysical context and past conditions of the surface on which these spiders form.</p>

									<p>In <b><a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2024/pdf/2576.pdf" target="_blank">Venkatraman et al. (2024)</a></b> I show that our mapping of spiders and
										lace across cryptic and non-cryptic latitudinal transects reveals significantly larger coverage in the former (~39,000 km<sup>2</sup>)
										than the latter (~3600 km<sup>2</sup>) terrain.
										This is consistent with the Kieffer notion that insolation, and thus spider density, increases with increased ice translucency.
										The non-cryptic region shows little to no spider formation, which is consistent with the residual cap’s high albedo and degree of competence.
										Spiders in the cryptic region closely follows SPLD contours. Outside the SPLD, spiders appear on crater ejecta and impact breccia-rich units suggesting they tend to form on easily eroded material. 
										Our ongoing work investigates the role of water in cryptic ice formation using measurements from TES.

										is a ground-penetrating radar (GPR) with the goal of probing the ground beneath the rover to 
										capture the subsurface geology of Mars. <b>RIMFAX can detect ice more than 10 m beneath the Martian surface, capturing geologic evidence 
										retained in the subsurface rock, and giving us insight into the planet's wet and warm past.</b></p>

									<p>As a result of being several cm off the ground, RIMFAX can output ambiguous radargrams that are not representative of the true 
										subsurface stratigraphy. I worked on diagnosing this issue by <b>testing our in-house GPR</b> at different heights.</p>
