									<p><b>Ice on Mars</b> has been of interest to planetary scientists, geologists, and astrobiologists for decades. It plays a key role in 
										understanding Mars'- and by extension Earth's- geologic and climatic history. Since water and ice support life as we know it on Earth, 
										Martian ice holds great astrobiological value and supports future exploration of our Solar System. It follows that studying the nature 
										of Martian surface and subsurface ice can tell us a lot about the planet's history. Consequently, <b>I am interested in exploring the 
										cryo-geology of the Red Planet, and how it can inform our knowledge of its water-rich past.</b> <i>(left) North and south polar caps of

									<p>Araneiforms, colloquially termed <i>spiders</i>, are  <b>Martian ice sublimation features</b> that have no known Earth analogs. They are 
										characterized by a central depression with radially emerging dendritic troughs <i>(left)</i>. Spiders are 
										thought to form to their current extent as a result of the extension and recession of seasonal CO<sub>2</sub> ice overlying 
										the South Polar Layered Deposit (SPLD) cryptic region.</p>
									
									<p>Owing to the lack of ground truth observations and field analogs, <b>these features are relatively poorly understood</b>. Despite multiple observational 
										campaigns over the last 6 MY, although plumes likely associated with spiders have been observed to disappear and 
										reappear, no spiders have been observed to actively form or grow on the SPLD. <b>I currently work with the Mars Science team at JPL to investigate 
										the differences between spiders in the cryptic and non-cryptic regions of the SPLD to further understand the conditions associated 
										with their formation.</b> This can help us draw conclusions about geologic context and paleoclimate of spiders, and thereby Mars.</p>

										<img src="images/pic13.png" alt="" />
									</div>	

									<p>Our mapping of spiders and lace overlayed on the geologic maps from Tanaka and Scott (1987) is shown below. The spiders and lace terrain in the cryptic region cover far more area than those in the non-cryptic 
										terrain <i>(fig. left)</i>: the non-cryptic spiders and lace cover a total of ~3600 sq km, while those in the cryptic cover ~39,000 sq km. These results make sense 
										within the context of the Kieffer model as the greater the ice translucency, the more likely it is for underlying substrate to heat the ice above it, 
										creating the plumes that lead to the formation of spiders. Spiders and lace also tend to cluster quite a bit more in the cryptic terrain as opposed to 
										the non-cryptic. In other words, our mapped shapefiles cover more contiguous regions in the cryptic than in the non-cryptic. This may suggest that 
										cryptic spiders formed contemporaneously under a past climate with more favorable conditions.</p>

									<p>Comparing our spider distribution to the nature of underlying substrate, we see in the cryptic 
										region that spiders follow closely the contours of the SPLD. This is consistent with many previous studies that report the same findings. A few spider 
										clusters form outside the SPLD on buried crater ejecta unit Icm1  in dark brown, and the highlands cratered unit Npl1 in tan. Npl1 is heavily cratered 
										and contains a lot of impact breccias. Schwamb et al. (2019) reported 96 spider detections that were outside the SPLD, including on possible ejecta 
										blankets. In both these cases the likely hypothesis is that crater ejecta blankets are easily eroded and thus slab ice would not need to be present for 
										as long, or be as thick, as on the SPLD for spiders to form. In the non-cryptic region, spiders and lace do not form on the permanent cap. This is also 
										consistent with previous studies, and the absence of spiders in this region is generally understood as a consequence of the capâ€™s  high albedo and high 
										degree of competence, making them absorb less solar radiation, and be less susceptible to scouring.</p>

									<p>The <u>R</u>adar <u>I</u>mager for <u>M</u>ars' Subsur<u>fa</u>ce E<u>x</u>periment or RIMFAX aboard the Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover 
										<i>(image left credit: NASA Science)</i> is a ground-penetrating radar (GPR) with the goal of probing the ground beneath the rover to 
										capture the subsurface geology of Mars. <b>RIMFAX can detect ice more than 10 m beneath the Martian surface, capturing geologic evidence 
										retained in the subsurface rock, and giving us insight into the planet's wet and warm past.</b></p>

									<p>As a result of being several cm off the ground, RIMFAX can output ambiguous radargrams that are not representative of the true 
										subsurface stratigraphy. I worked on diagnosing this issue by <b>testing our in-house GPR</b> at different heights 
										<i>(image below)</i>.</p>
